# CV 

This repo is routinely updated with my current CV / resume: [simone_skeen_cv.pdf](https://github.com/sskeen/CV/blob/main/simone_skeen_cv.pdf). This version is in a deliberately maximalist format that combines both academic CV and professional resume conventions, spanning my entire work history. Tailored application materials, by design, may highlight relevant positions, skills, and deliverables. 

My contact details, and full-text links to my publications, are available at [simoneskeen.xyz](https://simoneskeen.xyz/).
